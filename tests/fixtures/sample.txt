Hybrid RAG Search System Overview

This document describes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines multiple search methods for improved retrieval accuracy.

Key Features:
1. Dense Retrieval: Uses vector embeddings from a multilingual-e5-base model to capture semantic similarity between queries and documents.
2. Sparse Retrieval: Implements BM25-style full-text search using PostgreSQL's tsvector and ts_rank functions.
3. Trigram Similarity: Leverages pg_trgm extension for fuzzy text matching and typo tolerance.
4. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF): Combines results from all three methods using RRF algorithm with k=60.

The system is designed for local deployment and supports Korean and English text processing.

Technical Stack:
- FastAPI for the REST API
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector storage
- Sentence-transformers for text embedding
- Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct for answer generation

Use Cases:
- Document Q&A: Ask questions about uploaded documents and receive AI-generated answers
- Semantic Search: Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
- Knowledge Management: Store and retrieve organizational knowledge efficiently
